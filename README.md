# sudoku

A Sudoku game in React!

This project aims to highlight the use of React to build a game and also maintaining state in one place. By having a 'Single Source of Truth', it becomes easier to keep updating the different parts of the UI based on state changes!

A fun way to learn React for those who are still in the beginning stages!

Features:

* Only functional components!
* useEffect, useState hooks instead of state.
* Simple use of `props`.
* All the game logic resides in a single component.
* Use CSS Custom properties to keep the stylesheet DRY.
* Understand how functions can be sent down as `props` and consumed.
* Typescript for static type checking!
